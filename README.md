# "k"need
a running list of what (NEEDS) to be done

to be treated with the respect I deserve

to not be made to participate in activities to which i am diametrically opposed

to be awarded my fair share of the activities to which I have been an unwitting participant

to be compensated for when i am a witting participant in activities that I know to be in opposition of the greater good  (miracles aren't free for industry, why should they be for the government?) 

the evidence of which can be seen in mr bezos donation to scientology the end of last year (he obviously paid for some help with making regulatory bodies look the other way while he "WON AMERICAN capitolISM")

take a long hard look at
